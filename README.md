# 👋 Hi, I'm Kingsley Usa!  

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm a **Junior Software Engineer** passionate about building robust backend systems, developing APIs, and occasionally diving into full-stack projects.

## 🌟 About Me  

So here’s the deal: I thrive on solving problems and bringing ideas to life through code. While I have a particular love for backend development (Django and Python hold a special place in my heart ❤️), I often find myself working across the full stack—and hey, I won’t complain about tackling frontend challenges either.  

I’m drawn to APIs like a moth to a flame. There’s something endlessly fascinating about designing, building, and optimizing them. Whether it’s crafting elegant endpoints or ensuring seamless integration, I’m all in.

## 🛠️ My Toolbox  

Here’s a glimpse into the tools and technologies I use to bring projects to life:

### **Languages**
- Python 🐍 (my first love)
- JavaScript (because frontend needs love too)
- TypeScript (strictly for the fun of strict typing 😎)
- C (low-level programming is where the real power lies)

### **Backend**
- Django & Django REST Framework
- Flask  
- Express.js  

### **Frontend**
- React.js  
- Next.js  
- Tailwind CSS  

### **Database**
- PostgreSQL  
- MySQL  
- SQLite  

### **Tools & Workflow**
- Git & GitHub  
- Vite  
- Docker  
- Postman (for API tinkering)  
- ESLint & Prettier (because pretty code matters)

## 🚀 My Projects  

Here are some highlights of what I’ve been working on:  

### [Kingsley's Portfolio](https://github.com/TheKingsident/kingsley-portfolio)  
A modern, responsive portfolio website built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It showcases my skills and projects as a software engineer.  
- **Why I built it**: To create a professional online presence that reflects my technical skills and creativity.  
- **Challenges faced**: Let’s just say designing isn’t my strong suit, but I pushed through and made it work (bragging rights included 😁).  
- **Live site**: [www.kingsleyusa.dev](https://www.kingsleyusa.dev)

### [Algorithm Visualizer](https://github.com/TheKingsident/algorithm-visualizer)  
An interactive **Next.js** app that visually demonstrates sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.  
- **Why I built it**: I wanted to make learning algorithms fun and intuitive. Plus, seeing them in action is just plain cool.  
- **Key features**: Algorithm picker, dynamic visualization, and detailed info sheets.  
- **Live demo**: [Algorithm Visualizer](https://algorithm-visualizer-five-pi.vercel.app/)

### [Chattrix](https://github.com/TheKingsident/chattrix)  
A **YouTube Comment Search** app built with **Next.js** (frontend) and **Flask** (backend).  
- **What it does**: Fetches and filters comments from YouTube videos based on keywords.  
- **Why I built it**: I’m fascinated by APIs, and this project let me dive deep into the **YouTube Data API**.  
- **Live demo**: [Frontend](https://chattrix.vercel.app/) | [Backend](https://chattrix-backend.onrender.com/)

### [Grocery Store Management System](https://github.com/TheKingsident/grocery-store-ms)  
A Python-based **CLI application** that helps manage grocery items, record sales, and analyze transactions.  
- **Why I built it**: To explore how Python can be used for real-world, data-driven applications.  
- **Key features**: User authentication, transaction tracking, and sales analysis.  

---

### [Interactive Quiz](https://github.com/TheKingsident/interactive-quiz)  
A **Django-based quiz application** with a RESTful API.  
- **What it does**: Allows users to take quizzes, stores scores, and provides an API for managing quiz data.  
- **Why I built it**: I wanted to combine my love for Django with API development.

## 📚 What I’m Learning  

I believe growth is constant, so here are some things I’m currently exploring:  
- Advanced **Django REST Framework** techniques.  
- Optimizing APIs for performance and scalability.  
- Deep diving into **React** and **Next.js** for better frontend workflows.  
- Containerization with **Docker**.
